I have taken a website named small pdf- for testing the creation of account, logging in, updations, deltions and searching functionlities.
Initially, I created an account in the website and wrote testcases for it.
Then, I've written testcases for login, update, delete and search functions similarly.
I've created 3 more accounts and mentioned all those credentials in logindata.
4 different scenarios were taken for login i.e.
    (i) both email & password are correct 
    (ii) Only email is corect 
    (iii) Only password is correct 
    (iv) both email and password are wrong.
During the login process, all these 4 scenarios are verified.
In delete function, i've tried to delete the files which are uploaded in the account
In search function, the word which is searched will get filtered and it appears on the page.
